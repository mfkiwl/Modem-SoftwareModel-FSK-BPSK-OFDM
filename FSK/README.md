Matlab implementation of FSK Modem:

This project is presented as a midterm exam for the course Digital Signal Processing (EE-556)
Binary data is modulated using FSK techniques and detected using:
a) Bandpass filters
b) Complex sinusoids
c) Derivative functions   
d) Hilbert transform
e) Arc tangent
